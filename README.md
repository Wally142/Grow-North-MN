# Known issues:

Directory page:
- After deleting profile, sometimes page will refresh before profile deleted and still show up in directory until manually.

#Clean up:
- Do we actually need $http injected into DirectoryController?
- vm.approve and vm.getApproval functions needed in DirectoryController?
